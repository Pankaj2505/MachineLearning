<p><strong>challanges in ML problem</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>What is the problem , then check how ML can help you.</li>
  <li>Exploratory data analysis can help you understand your data.</li>
  <li>collect the data, thousand of sample for ML models and hundreds of thusand of sample for neural networks.</li>
  <li>Predictive power depends on features.
    <ul>
      <li>You should not try to make ML do the hard work of discovering which features are relevant for you. If you simply throw everything at the model and see what looks useful, your model will likely wind up overly complicated, expensive, and filled with unimportant features.</li>
      <li>perform inferential statistics for smaller datasets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aim to make decision , from the prediction.
    <ul>
      <li>like recommanded system once recommend something, you have to provide the link for recommendation.</li>
      <li>show ads only when probability of click is greater than threshold.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>define cluster name</li>
  <li>what will happen if a new data comes in production what to do then.</li>
  <li>ML models are not always good, heauristic(if /else ) approach can fix anamolies detection easily</li>
  <li>there is diffrence between corelation and causation
    <ul>
      <li>coorelation mean , how one feature is changing according to the change in other feature</li>
      <li>caustion mean , change is one fature is causing change in other feature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>10 - Challanges in data gathering</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Your model can make predictions at either of two points:<br />
        In real time, in response to user activity (online).<br />
        As a batch and then cached (offline).</p>
</blockquote>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>- What data does your code have access to when it needs to call the model?
- What are your latency requirements? Do you need to run quickly to avoid lagging in your UI, or are you running without a user waiting for your model?
-  be wary of using out-of-date data. 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Approach for implementing ML</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Objective - what would you like your ML model to do?
 some time a related but indirect goal can help to realise main goal.
    <ul>
      <li>We want the ML model to predict how popular a video just uploaded will become in the future.</li>
      <li>indirect goal - predict the share count , and predict the watch time.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Your IDEAL outcome Decision - what should your model do after predicting, what is the outcome.
    <ul>
      <li>here we want to recommend only those videos which are worthtime of users.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Design an approach-(look for feature needed for trainng)
    <ul>
      <li>for above problem , we want to collect ‚Äúcategory of video‚Äù and there ‚Äúwatched time‚Äù, ‚Äúclick count‚Äù.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Success or failure metric
    <ul>
      <li>define which metric you will choose
        <ul>
          <li>precision /recall/AUC(Area under ROC curve)(Receiver operating chracterstic curve).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>quantify the metric
        <ul>
          <li>how much presion value mean success/failure.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>you should know other factors which can fail the model
        <ul>
          <li>availabilty of data to model</li>
          <li>latancy in data availbilty</li>
          <li>very old data is trained</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>you should be aware which ML algo to use for what type of problem</li>
